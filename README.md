# Niko Hoffrén Music - website

![Niko Hoffrén Music](https://github.com/nikohoffren/nikohoffren-homepage/blob/main/public/NHlogo.jpg?raw=true)

This repository contains the code for my music production website. The website shows all the information you need with showcase of my music, videos and gear. It also supports language selection, allowing users to switch between Finnish and English languages seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Reflection

I chose to use Vite for this project due to its fast and lean build tool, allowing for a quicker development process. TypeScript was used to provide static type checking, and Tailwind CSS allowed me to style the website easily with low-level utility classes.
